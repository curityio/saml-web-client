# PME Storyline

- You can modernize security for new applications while still running old apps.
- You can migrate from old identity systems like ADFS.
- Both SAML and OAuth apps can use modern authentication from the Curity Identity Server.

## Code Example

If I can keep this simple I might add a code example website resource:

- Anyone can run it
- Implements mainstream SAML flows
- Could use some interesting authentication options?
- Shows how to update from ADFS by just changing configuration?

## SAML

Read System Admin guide and also read up on ADFS 4.0:

## Node.js Tech

The passport SAML notes include notes on ADFS:
